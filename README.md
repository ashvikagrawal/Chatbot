# Chatbot

This program implements a basic rule-based chatbot using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). It defines a set of regular expression patterns paired with appropriate responses, allowing the chatbot to recognize specific inputs like greetings, questions about its name, or general help requests. When the user types a message, the chatbot matches the input against these patterns and returns a corresponding response. If no pattern matches, it gives a generic fallback reply. The program uses NLTKâ€™s built-in Chat and reflections utilities and includes basic NLP elements like tokenization and stopword downloads, though they are not actively used in this version.
